							<p>&ldquo;During our partnership, I thoroughly enjoyed working with Zak for multiple reasons: <br><br>
								1) Positive and professional demeanor - Zak was always a pleasure to speak to and was prepared to transition quickly to the task at hand. <br>
								2) Attention to detail - Zak was extremely organized and had well prepared notes and status updates for each of our conversations. This allowed us to quickly prioritize and focus on our biggest opportunities.<br>
								3) Results focused - Zak drove our conversions and followed up with leaders in a respectful but firm manner to drive candidate experience, timely requisition closure, and reduced time to fill.<br>
								<br>
								Appreciate your partnership Zak, best of luck to you!&rdquo;</p>

							<p>&ldquo;I had the pleasure of working with Zak and Kensington Additive on the
								development of their new website. They chose Wave (WaveSites) as their new website provider. Throughout the process, I was consistently
								impressed by Zak's knowledge on the development process, clear communication and his strong collaborative spirit. Specifically, Zak
								demonstrated his knowledge of the recruitment industry by outlining the specific niche in which Kensington Additive is recruiting talents.
								His ability to adapt to ideas and suggestions proved invaluable in the positive outcome for the project. These qualities, coupled with his
								positive personality traits, created a smooth and productive collaboration. Overall, I highly recommend Zak as recruitment consultant to
								anyone seeking a new job in the additive manufacturing industry. His collaborative spirit, clear communication, and strong understanding
								of the recruitment landscape make him an outstanding consultant.&rdquo;</p>

							<p>&ldquo;Zak helped me a lot during my job search by suggesting a very interesting job position to me and guiding me through the company's recruitment process.

								I was approached by Zak when I was looking for a new job as a software developer. He suggested a very interesting job position that greatly matched my profile. Since it is quite common in my field to be approached by recruiters, I really appreciate being notified of an offer that actually aligns very well with my interests.

								Zak guided me through the recruitment process, and being able to discuss with an ally is very helpful in that sort of situation. I was given helpful pointers and tips, and had the opportunity to share updates and unpack things with him regularly via email or on the phone.

								Overall, I really appreciated the help and care, and I wish all head hunters were like this.

								Thank you for your help Zak.&rdquo;</p>

							<p>&ldquo;Zak is exceptional at what he does! while we worked together we never missed any details
								in the interview process, we always kept in touch through emails, phone calls, left messages, our communication was direct and honest,
								Zak was always an advocate and negotiator, so that the (us) both parties came to a final agreement.&rdquo;</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>&ldquo;Zak and I connected while I was in the middle of a job hunt, and it was a blast from start to finish. He listened intently as I spoke about my previous job experience and future career goals, and quickly paired me with an engineering position I was very interested in. Although I ended up accepting an offer with a different firm, Zak made the process a breeze: vouched to the employers on my behalf, set up an interview time and date, and briefed me on the company and how I should prepare for the interview, not to mention he was extremely personable and cordial the whole time! Even if it is many years down the road, if my employment situation was to change and I am in need of a recruiter, Zak will definitely be one of the first people I reach out to. Keep up the great work!&rdquo;</p>

							<p>&ldquo;I had the pleasure of being recruited by Zak and I really appreciated his work.
								He found the perfect project and company for me when it wasn't easy, especially because of my location.<br>
								I worked as a consultant for a few years and have been in contact with many recruiters and HR managers and Zak may be the best I've met.
								He gets the job done, he has exceeded all my expectations, he is kind, he is available, he really cares about the person he is interviewing, he does his best to make sure everyone is satisfied, he tries to get feedback and he also provides honest feedback. I don't have any words to say how happy I am with the project he recruited me for.<br>

								As a recruiter, I would call his work perfect, but as a person, his kindness, honesty, and thoroughness are the reasons I have no doubt that he is the best recruiter I have ever met.
