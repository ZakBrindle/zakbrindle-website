								2) Attention to detail - Zak was extremely organized and had well prepared notes and status updates for each of our conversations. This allowed us to quickly prioritize and focus on our biggest opportunities.<br>
								3) Results focused - Zak drove our conversions and followed up with leaders in a respectful but firm manner to drive candidate experience, timely requisition closure, and reduced time to fill.<br>

							<p>&ldquo;Zak helped me a lot during my job search by suggesting a very interesting job position to me and guiding me through the company's recruitment process.

								I was approached by Zak when I was looking for a new job as a software developer. He suggested a very interesting job position that greatly matched my profile. Since it is quite common in my field to be approached by recruiters, I really appreciate being notified of an offer that actually aligns very well with my interests.

								Zak guided me through the recruitment process, and being able to discuss with an ally is very helpful in that sort of situation. I was given helpful pointers and tips, and had the opportunity to share updates and unpack things with him regularly via email or on the phone.

								Overall, I really appreciated the help and care, and I wish all head hunters were like this.

								Thank you for your help Zak.&rdquo;</p>

								He found the perfect project and company for me when it wasn't easy, especially because of my location.<br>
								I worked as a consultant for a few years and have been in contact with many recruiters and HR managers and Zak may be the best I've met.
								He gets the job done, he has exceeded all my expectations, he is kind, he is available, he really cares about the person he is interviewing, he does his best to make sure everyone is satisfied, he tries to get feedback and he also provides honest feedback. I don't have any words to say how happy I am with the project he recruited me for.<br>
								<br>
								As a recruiter, I would call his work perfect, but as a person, his kindness, honesty, and thoroughness are the reasons I have no doubt that he is the best recruiter I have ever met.
								<br>
								He is committed to getting the best for everyone he works with and it shows in his demeanor.&rdquo;</p>
