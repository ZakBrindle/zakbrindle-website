							<p>&ldquo;I had the pleasure of working with Zak and Kensington Additive on the

								impressed by Zak's knowledge on the development process, clear communication and his strong collaborative spirit. Specifically, Zak
								demonstrated his knowledge of the recruitment industry by outlining the specific niche in which Kensington Additive is recruiting talents.
								His ability to adapt to ideas and suggestions proved invaluable in the positive outcome for the project. These qualities, coupled with his
								positive personality traits, created a smooth and productive collaboration. Overall, I highly recommend Zak as recruitment consultant to
								anyone seeking a new job in the additive manufacturing industry. His collaborative spirit, clear communication, and strong understanding
								of the recruitment landscape make him an outstanding consultant.&rdquo;</p>

Since it is quite common in my field to be approached by recruiters, I really appreciate being notified of an offer that actually aligns very well with my interests.

								Zak guided me through the recruitment process, and being able to discuss with an ally is very helpful in that sort of situation. I was given helpful pointers and tips, and had the opportunity to share updates and unpack things with him regularly via email or on the phone.

Even if it is many years down the road, if my employment situation was to change and I am in need of a recruiter, Zak will definitely be one of the first people I reach out to.
